# INIParser2
An INI Parsing library made for C# applications

## Purpose
I practically had 0 C# experience, but I've worked with Java, C, and C++. I made this project in a few days, and the only reason it even took that long was because my IDE was fighting me along the way. 

In short, I made this project to show I am capable of learning something new on my own (or with Chase's guidance) in short amounts of time.

## Notes
I didn't comment this library as detailed as I normally would, mainly because it's such a simple library, but also because I was on a bit of a time crunch.

I do comment as I go and you can see that in the project, and in the future I plan to use doxygen in the future for documentation.
